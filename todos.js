/*
    This is a list of TODOs

    - If a creep is carrying something that isn't energy, have them store it
    - Write something that knows how many spots each source has
        - Perhaps polling how many creeps are using each source and adjusting that if a source has run out would be good? I could make more efficient use of available resources tha way.
    - Start using Ramparts
